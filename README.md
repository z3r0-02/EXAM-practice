# EXAM-practice
Functions I tried and solved, while practicing for the upcoming Exams in 42.

Mainly used: https://github.com/JCluzet/42_EXAM for testing, which can be cloned to your repository or launched with: 
 - ```bash -c "$(curl https://grademe.fr)"```
 
It is a simulation of actual Exams, with traces and cooldowns.
<br>Be aware that passing these simulations won't guarantee passing the actual test. Especially when INT_MIN is at play...
<br>Read the subject carefully... Test a lot...
